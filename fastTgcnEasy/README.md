# General

My version of fastTgcn with the same changes necessary to run as fastTgcn needed as well as fixing other errors. Main idea is the functionization of the process so you can specify filepaths, upper vs lower jaw, ect without actually having to edit the code.

Run via:

```shell
python train.py
```

# Changes from fastTgcn

* functionizing process for ease of use
* original fastTgcn had no labeling for gum category in upper arch, fixed. Now the same as lower arch.


# Next steps

* make output understandable, one file that tells me general model performance
